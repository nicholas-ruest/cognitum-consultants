//! Nexus event ingestion → `NotificationItem`/`ActionQueueEntry` mapping
//! (PROMPT-30, ADR-011's "Nexus → BFF ingestion... via polling" decision).
//!
//! `bff-api` (PROMPT-30) owns the actual polling loop — it needs
//! `nexus-client`'s transport and needs to run as a background tokio task,
//! neither of which belongs in this crate (ADR-004). This module owns
//! everything capability-agnostic: the wire envelope
//! ([`CapabilityEventReceived`]), the classify-and-route decision
//! ([`classify`]), the idempotent-ingestion service ([`ingest_events`]), and
//! the internal pub/sub primitive ([`EventBus`]) ingestion publishes into.
//!
//! # `consultant_id`: a pragmatic addition beyond the DDD doc's envelope
//! `../ddd/domain-events.md` §2 lists `CapabilityEventReceived`'s "rough
//! payload" as `origin_capability, origin_event_id, event_type, summary,
//! deep_link, received_at` — explicitly called "rough", and explicitly
//! missing any field identifying *which consultant* the event is for. Both
//! [`crate::NotificationItem`] and [`crate::ActionQueueEntry`] require a
//! non-empty `consultant_id` (invariant 4 / structural requirement on each
//! aggregate), and this repo has no other way to derive one from Nexus's
//! actual (unknown, provisional per ADR-007) event contract. Rather than
//! leave per-consultant targeting unresolved, [`CapabilityEventReceived`]
//! here adds a `consultant_id: String` field beyond the DDD doc's sketch —
//! a pragmatic, flagged assumption Nexus's real contract will need to
//! confirm or correct, not a silent invention: every real event source this
//! repo integrates with (Sales, first) already carries `consultant_id` on
//! its own outbound commands (see `nexus_client::sales`), so it is
//! reasonable to expect Nexus's normalized envelope to carry it back too.
//!
//! # Two dedup layers — do not confuse them
//! 1. **Idempotent save (this module, correctness guarantee)**: the
//!    `(origin_capability, origin_event_id)` unique constraint (ADR-010,
//!    PROMPT-29) that [`NotificationRepository::save`]/[`ActionQueueRepository::save`]
//!    enforce. [`ingest_events`] relies on [`SaveOutcome`] to know whether a
//!    given event was actually new, and only publishes to the [`EventBus`]
//!    on [`SaveOutcome::Inserted`] — a duplicate delivery within, or across,
//!    calls to [`ingest_events`] never produces a second row *or* a second
//!    bus publish.
//! 2. **Cursor/watermark (`bff-api`'s polling loop, efficiency mechanism)**:
//!    a *separate*, best-effort optimization that avoids re-fetching
//!    already-seen events from Nexus in the first place. See
//!    `bff-api::event_ingestion`'s module docs for that half. Losing the
//!    cursor (e.g. a restart) is not a correctness problem — layer 1 above
//!    still holds — only a wasted round-trip.

///   PROMPT-30's own worked example (Execution's event of the same name
